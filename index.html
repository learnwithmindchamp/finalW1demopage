    <h2>Why Is It Called The "Solar" System?</h2>
<p>
There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. <br> Our planetary system is named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar." <br>
Our planetary system is located in an outer spiral arm of the<a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/milkyway1.html"> Milky Way galaxy</a>.<br>

Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. <br> Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>

  <p>Our solar system’s small bodies—asteroids, comets and meteors—pack big surprises. <br><br>Asteroids and comets—and the meteors that sometimes come from them—are leftovers from the formation of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. While the planets and moons have changed over the millennia, many of these small chunks of ice, rock and metal have not.<br> They are a lot like a fossil record of planetary evolution.
There are currently 1,071,008 known asteroids and 3,720 known comets.
